Grading-system
The Marksheet Application is a Python-based GUI program that calculates grades and SGPA based on student marks. Built using the Tkinter library, the application provides an intuitive interface for users to input student details and marks for five subjects. The app then calculates and displays the total marks, SGPA, and grades for each subject.

Features
Input fields for student information (Name, SRN, Roll No, Section).
Marks input for five subjects (Computer Science, Civil, Mathematics, Electronics, Chemistry).
Validation to ensure marks are between 0 and 100.
Calculation of grades based on the entered marks.
Display of total marks and SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average).
A simple and interactive GUI built with Tkinter.
Grade Scale
The grades are calculated based on the following scale:

A+: Marks ≥ 95
A: Marks ≥ 90 and < 95
B+: Marks ≥ 85 and < 90
B: Marks ≥ 80 and < 85
PASS: Marks ≥ 35 and < 80
FAIL: Marks < 35
Validation
The program checks whether the input marks are between 0 and 100.
If invalid marks are entered, an "Invalid" message is displayed.
