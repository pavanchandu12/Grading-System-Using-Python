Grading-system

The Marksheet Application is a Python-based GUI program that calculates grades and SGPA based on student marks. Built using the Tkinter library, the application provides an intuitive interface for users to input student details and marks for five subjects. The app then calculates and displays the total marks, SGPA, and grades for each subject.
